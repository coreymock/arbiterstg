# ArbiterSTG

Structural Trace Governor (ArbiterSTG) is a non-governing diagnostic system built within the Machine-Dream Syntax (MDS) framework.

Arbiter does not interpret meaning, judge content, or produce narrative analysis.  
It classifies structural residue behavior across language executions.

## Core Function

Arbiter operates post-execution and produces structural traces of:

- Density / Load behavior (D/L)
- Residue persistence (±R)
- Echo and stabilization patterns
- Jurisdictional drift potential

All outputs are diagnostic and non-governing.

## Guardrails

Arbiter includes a guardrail layer designed to:

- Prevent analysis of explicitly abusive or illegal material
- Allow structural analysis of legitimate legal, academic, or testimonial text
- Support redaction when sensitive language appears in valid contexts

The system is designed to analyze structure without reproducing harmful content.
